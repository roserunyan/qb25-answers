## Exercise 1.3
Examine the PCA plot. Does everything look okay (We wouldn’t ask if it did)?
- The data is spread very far apart. ALthough these are different tissues, they should not be quite so spread out. \
What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
- The data has not been normalized to account for different expression levels across genes. \
What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
- The first PC shows the largest variation in the data, which is the variation in gene expression between tissue types.
