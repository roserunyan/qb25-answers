```

## Plotting Gene Density

```{r}
# Load Libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Read in file
setwd("~/qb25-answers/week1")
header <- c("chr", "start", "end", "count")
df_kc <- read_tsv("hg19-kc-count.bed", col_names=header)
```

```{r}
# Make plot with ggplot
ggplot(data = df_kc, aes(x=start, y=count)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(chr ~ ., scales="free")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
