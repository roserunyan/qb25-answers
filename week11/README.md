# Week 11 Assignment
## Step 1.1
1. How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?
- 3x coverage= 3 x 1Mb genome = 3Mb
- 3Mb / 100bp reads = **30,000 100 bp reads**

## Steps 1.4
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- 49,986
2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- It matches Poisson expectations pretty well with just a few gaps and it matches the normal distribution pretty well

## Steps 1.5
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- 73
2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- It matches a lot better than 3x coverage, just.a few gaps between the Poisson and is slightly off center from the normal distribution.

## Steps 1.6
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- 12
2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- This fits almost exactly
